!!OBSOLETE!!

Note, somone finally had the patience/pigheadedness to break down the lkml enough to actuallly
allow a bugfix to this driver, and parity/flowcontrol/wordsize are now all properly supported since about 4.9/4.10, 
with a bunch more little fixes and cleanups around the 4.10/4.11.  You shouldn't need any of this work anymore,
nor should you need you need any other drivers for these parts.

~~~~~ original notes below ~~~~~~


notes on adding parity control support to ch341.c, the linux driver for, 
as BSD calls it, "the worst usb serial chip in the world"

it actually works just fine in windows, and in linux with no-parity, at least
for the basic usages I have for it, but yeah, it's ugly datasheet world :)

Now to just actually edit the kernel module...

Enabling debug from the kernel module:
sudo su -c 'echo "file ch341.c +p" > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control'
or
sudo su -c 'echo "module ch341 +p" > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control'

Building it (from a linux tree checkout matching your running kernel on
fedora...)
make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build M=`pwd`/drivers/usb/serial modules

(First time, to get that running kernel... notes to self...
make mrproper
cp /boot/config-xxxx .config
make oldconfig
make
make modules
sudo make modules_install
sudo make install
~reboot here~
